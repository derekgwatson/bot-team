# Pam Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit .env to git!

# Note: Google OAuth credentials (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)
# and BOT_API_KEY are in the shared .env file at the root of bot-team/

# Flask secret key for sessions (generate a random string)
# Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Optional: Enable Flask debug mode (defaults to False for security)
# Set to "true" for development - shows detailed errors and auto-reloads
# FLASK_DEBUG=true

# Access Control (automatic - no configuration needed!)
# Pam automatically allows access to:
# 1. Anyone with a company email (@watsonblinds.com.au, etc.)
# 2. External staff approved by Quinn
# No need to manually maintain an allowed emails list!

# Note: Pam queries Chester's service registry for other bot URLs
# CHESTER_API_URL is required in the shared .env
# No need to configure individual bot URLs!
