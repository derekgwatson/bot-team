  # Timeouts are EMERGENCY CIRCUIT BREAKERS - code watches browser state for actual completion
  # These should be so long they almost never trigger - they catch truly broken scenarios
  login_timeout: 300000      # 5 minutes - emergency safety net
  navigation_timeout: 120000 # 2 minutes - emergency safety net
  save_timeout: 1800000      # 30 minutes - emergency safety net (Buz can be slow, we watch network idle)
