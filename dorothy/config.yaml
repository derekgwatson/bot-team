# NOTE: Bot deployment configurations are managed exclusively by Chester.
# Dorothy queries Chester's API at /api/deployment/bots to get bot configs.
#
# To manage bot configurations:
#   - Use Chester's web UI: http://localhost:8008/manage
#   - Use Chester's REST API: POST /api/deployment/bots
#
# Chester must be running for Dorothy to retrieve bot configurations.
# There is no local fallback - Chester is the single source of truth.
