# Sally's SSH Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Path to SSH private key for server access
# NOTE: Only required if managing REMOTE servers via SSH
# If Sally is deployed on the same server she's managing (e.g., Sally on prod managing prod),
# configure that server with host: localhost in config.local.yaml
# Sally will automatically use local execution instead of SSH - no key needed!

# Example for REMOTE server management:
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/var/www/bot-team/sally/id_rsa

# Optional: SSH key passphrase if your key is encrypted
# SSH_KEY_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase_here

# IMPORTANT: For local execution (Sally managing the server she's on):
# 1. Don't set SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH (comment it out or leave it unset)
# 2. In config.local.yaml, set your server's host to 'localhost'
# 3. Sally will use subprocess instead of SSH - fast and no keys needed!
