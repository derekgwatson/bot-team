# Local configuration overrides for Sally
# Copy this file to config.local.yaml and customize for your environment
# config.local.yaml is gitignored and won't be committed

# IMPORTANT: If Sally is deployed ON the production server, configure prod to use localhost
# This enables local execution (no SSH needed, no SSH keys required!)
# Otherwise, configure with the actual hostname/IP for remote SSH access

# Override server configuration
servers:
  # Example 1: Sally is ON the prod server - use localhost for local execution
  prod:
    host: localhost     # Use localhost when Sally is deployed on prod
    user: ubuntu        # User is ignored for localhost, but required
    description: Production Server (Local)

  # Example 2: Sally is managing a REMOTE staging server - use actual hostname
  # staging:
  #   host: staging.example.com
  #   user: ubuntu
  #   description: Staging Environment

  # Example 3: Sally on dev managing remote prod - use actual IP/hostname
  # prod:
  #   host: 203.45.67.89  # Production server IP/hostname
  #   user: ubuntu        # SSH user (needs SSH key in .env)
  #   description: Production Ubuntu Server

# You can also override other settings:
# ssh:
#   default_user: youruser
#   connect_timeout: 15
